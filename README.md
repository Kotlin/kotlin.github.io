# Kotlin GitHub Page
[![JetBrains team project](https://jb.gg/badges/team-flat-square.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub) 

This repo exists solely to populate [kotlin.github.io](https://kotlin.github.io) and redirects to [kotlinlang.org](https://kotlinlang.org).

It also provides titles and favicons for `kotlin.github.io/*` websites in search consoles like Google.

### Code of Conduct
The JetBrains Code of Conduct can be found [here](https://github.com/JetBrains/.github/tree/main/profile#code-of-conduct) and this project also adheres to it.

### Contribution
We won't accept pull requests unless there's broken/outdated behavior regarding either:
- the favicon (for instance, it's out of date)
- the title
- the redirect to [kotlinlang.org](https://kotlinlang.org)
- a missing html tag that prevents other search consoles from picking up the relevant icon or title(s).

### Why does this exist?
This repo was created to fix the issue [KTL-1336](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KTL-1336/Add-favicon-and-title-for-kotlin.github.io).
